# Fourier Transform Definition

Fourier Transform is defined on continuous functions:

for a function $f(x)$  $x \in \mathbb{R} \rightarrow f(x) \in \mathbb{C}$

the **Fourier transform** of $f$ is another function $F$ 

$F(X)$  $X \in \mathbb{R} \rightarrow F(X) \in \mathbb{C}$

$$
f \xrightarrow{FT} F
$$

$$
F(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(x) e^{-2i \pi x X} dx
$$

### Time vs Frequency

One example of the relation between time and frequencies - as observed in nature

<img style="width:800px" src="files/cochlea.png">


- $f(t)$  pressure wave / function of time.
- ear-drum vibrate with the same pattern $\rightarrow$ standing wave in the cochlea
- pressure nodesalong the cochlea spiral, *position F( frequency )* 

    - $\Rightarrow$ a mechanical Fourier transform !

phonetic pattern is somehow the time-dependent **Fourier transform** of the inital pressure wave.

They both carry somehow the same information, but in a very different way.

# Fourier Transform Definition (2)

So, using $x \rightarrow t$ as time

and $X \rightarrow \omega$ as frequency

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(t) e^{-2i \pi t \omega} dx
$$

is just a way to **weigh** the presence of a given frequency $\omega : e^{-2i \pi \omega t}$ in $f(t)$


$x$ and $X$ represent two different reciproqual quantitites, and can be found in many domains

|$x$   |$X$   |
| ----- | ----- |
| $t$ : time (sec) | $\omega$ : frequency (Hz) |
| $x$ : space (√Ö) | $k$ : spacial frequency (√Ö$^{-1}$) |
| $\lambda$ : wavelength ($cm$) | $k$ : spacial frequency ($cm^{-1}$) |
| etc... | |

## a brief reminder on complex numbers.
- *complex numbers are central to Fourier analysis, and their understanding is needed to fully comprehend the beauty of Fourier analysis*
- **Real** numbers are *regular* numbers, going from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ through every number you might want to use. They are said to belong to $\mathbb{R}$, the set of all real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$ can be seen as a line, going from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.

If Reals are on a line, **Complex** numbers are on a plane. 
As any plane, the coordinates are defined on two axes, the horizontal axis is the $\mathbb{R}$ line, the vertical one is the *Imaginary* axis, also holding real numbers, and labeled with $i$.
This plane is called $\mathbb{C}$ the complex plane.


A complex number $z$ (a point in this plane) is thus described with two numbers, $a$ and $b$: $$z = a +ib$$
$a$ is the real part, and $b$ the imaginary part.

The position of the complex point $z$ can also be described by its *module* (the distance to the center)
$$ |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$
and the angle with the horizontal axis, called the *argument*, usually noted with a greek letter:
$$ arg(z) = \arctan \left(\frac b a \right) = \theta$$
It is defined only between $[0 .. 2\pi]$ as any other angle.

A complex number is fully determined by $a$ and $b$, as well as by its modulus and argument.
This is noted using the *Euler* notation:
$$ z = a+ib \\
z = |z|e^{i \arg(z)} = |z|e^{i \theta} $$

Complex numbers can be added and multiplied, they form an *algebra*.
